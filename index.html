              <h2> Why battle Food Wastage? </h2>
                <p> Food is an important factor in our everyday life. We consume food to generate energy, and we use that energy to bring more bread to the table. Food nurtures our soul and body, and in many countries, it also represents our culture. The process of creating the food that we consume everyday requires a great amount of resources such as water, electricity, and crops, with the coordination between farmers, processors, transportation, and retailers. As complex as it can be, a huge percentage of our food production is going to waste. Therefore, by joining the fight against Food Wastage, we are saving resources for the future world of our children. </p>
